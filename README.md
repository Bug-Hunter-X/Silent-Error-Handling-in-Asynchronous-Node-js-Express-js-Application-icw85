# Silent Error Handling in Asynchronous Node.js Express.js Application

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js where errors in asynchronous operations are silently caught, making debugging difficult.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The application uses Express.js to handle a simple GET request.  It simulates an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) that might fail. The error handling within the `.catch` block only logs the error to the console but doesn't inform the client or take any further corrective action.  This silent failure can lead to unpredictable behavior and difficult debugging. 

## Solution

The corrected version (`bugSolution.js`) properly handles the error by sending an appropriate error response to the client (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error).  This provides a better user experience and helps in identifying and resolving issues effectively.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the erroneous behavior.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
